# About

This is a game meant to be a successor to Planetside 2.

## Technology

This game is being made using the Godot game engine. The architecture is an authoritative server that communicates directly to clients. 
The client's information that it sends to the server is never trusted, with the exception of inputs, chat messages and some misc. messages.
This project uses the main realease of Godot, however, it may be modified for performance and architeture.

# How to contribute

### Rules
1. Nothing obscene or immoral.
2. Absolutely no malware or code that changes files outside of the game's folders.
3. Try to inform people before changing code that they are actively working on or have a large investement into.


## Programming

### Getting started

How-to:
1. Download and install git(set line endings to the one suggested for linux).
2. Download Godot(no install needed).
3. (optional) Download the Git plugin from Godot's asset library(free).
4. Fork this project on Github and clone your fork to a folder on your computer.
5. Open a issue saying what you are going to work on, comment on an issue or just wait to discuss until later.
6. Create a branch for your work(or just switch to the "developement" branch) and start programming.
7. Commit your changes to your local branch(commit messages should be imperative e.g. "Add functionality to xyz").
8. Push the commits to your repository on Github.
9. Make a pull request on the main repository and link all relevant issues(create an issue if there are none).
10. Discuss your pull request and make any changes necessary to get it accepted.


### Guidelines for contributing
1. Keep all code seperated from other scripts. Instead of modifying another node's variables or attributes directly, instead use a signal or call a function on that node's script.
2. Functions without side effects are your best friend when debugging.
3. Comments for yourself, your friends, and for that random guy from the future.

## Art

### Getting started

How-to:
1. Make a folder called Assets in the project folder. The "Assets" folder is not managed by Git.
2. Add models, textures, music, animations, videos, etc. to the "Assets" folder(license must currently be CC-0).
3. Open an issue or comment on another issue about what assets you are going to add.
4. Upload final versions to a cloud storage service(not yet available).
5. Comment on the issue(or create a new issue) and make any needed changes before it is uploaded to the main storage server.
